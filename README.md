# Mario-Kart

Board game type application designed by myself (Adrian Azan) and Mitchel Shelton, developed by me. Example of program during game is included, but unfortunatley original source code was lost. Will try to recreate, possibly with non command line GUI

Before starting a race in mario kart, each player selects a 'tile' that they wish to capture. The player who wins recieves that tile and a point. A player can capture a bonus point by winning a tile that would completely surrond another tile from past races (won by either player)
